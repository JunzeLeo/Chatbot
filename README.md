# Recurrent Neural Network and Chat Robot

### Description

Developing a model employing ANN on real-world data requires going through several major steps, each of which with 
important design choices that directly impact the final results. 
In this project, we guide you through these choices starting from a large database of 
[conversations](http://parl.ai/downloads/personachat/personachat.tgz) to a functional chatbot. 

### Prerequisites

- You should have a running installation of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [keras](https://keras.io/).
- You should know the concepts "recurrent neural networks", "LSTM", "training and validation data", "overfitting" and "early stopping".
